# Code-A-Pookalam
"Code a Pookalam," hosted by FOSS MEC, invites participants to create innovative floral designs inspired by traditional Pookalam using programming. This event promotes creative coding skills through engaging activities, allowing exploration of coding and design. I achieved my design using Python's Turtle graphics library.
